# Outliers detection in IoT network and sensor data

A network has been proposed to send sensor readings over to the server, before sending the data to the server end, the data is checked for anomalies at the edge 
or in the cloud.

## Getting Started

Consider the mobile phones as sensors that sends constant readings to an edge device which runs the proposed BIRCH algorithm. At the edge, the data is checked for 
anomalies with the help of BIRCH algorithm. If the received reading is classified as an outlier than it is reported else it is sent to the server.

### Prerequisites

For python:
For network:


### Installing

Step by Step procedure: (Network)

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Check the latency time difference between the cloud network and edge network. The lower the latency time, the better the performance of network.


## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
